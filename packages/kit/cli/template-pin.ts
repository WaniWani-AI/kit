 * The distribution template this kit builds from, as data.

 * Its own module, with no prose wrapped around the value, because

 * branch moves. A file a bot edits is a file where the only line it can damage
 * is the one it means to write.
 *
 * Everything that names the template derives from this record: the `github:`
 * specifier in `./template.js`, the branch `bump-deps.ts` polls for a newer
 * commit, and the raw.githubusercontent URL it reads the template's manifest
 * from. Renaming the repo or moving the tracked branch is one line here.
