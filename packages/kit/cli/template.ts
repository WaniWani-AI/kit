/**
 * Resolve the distribution template.

 * The template is a separate public repo, consumed as-is. Nothing is forked
 * into this package: the generator downloads the repo at a pinned commit,
 * caches it, and copies the plumbing out of it. What ships to customers is the
 * same tree anyone can read on GitHub, clone, and deploy by hand.
 *
 * Sources:
 *   github:OWNER/REPO#REF   a GitHub repo at a branch, tag, or SHA (default)
 *   /path/to/checkout       a local clone, for working on the template itself
 *
 * Override per command with `--template <source>` or `WANIWANI_TEMPLATE`.

/**
 * A commit, not a branch.
 *
 * A published version of this package is frozen, and what it generates has to
 * be frozen with it. While the default was `beta`, the ref was re-resolved on
 * the customer's machine at every command, so a push to that branch changed the
 * output of every installed copy, and the assertions that catch a layout move
 * (`REQUIRED` and `assertSeam` in `./codegen.js`) fired in a customer's
 * terminal. Pinning a commit moves that failure into this repo's CI, where
 * `scripts/template-contract.ts` builds a real app against the pin before a
 * release goes out.
 *
 * Bumping it is a one-line diff, and `scripts/bump-deps.ts` proposes it. The
 * commit is on the template's `beta` branch: the generator is written against
 * that branch's layout (`vite.config.ts`, `src/server.ts`, `src/views/`), and
 * `main` is still the older `server/` + `web/` + `api/` split, which it cannot
 * absorb. An annotated tag can replace the SHA here whenever the template grows
 * one, with no change to the resolver.
 *
 * This commit is `beta`'s head, and it reads `search` and `tracking` off
 * `src/waniwani.ts` — the two fields `generateServerApp` emits from the app's
 * `defineApp({ ... })`. That pairing is the reason to bump the two together:
 * moving the pin here without the generator emitting those fields compiles to
 * TS2339, and the contract is what catches it.
 *
 * Working on the template itself does not need a release: pass `--template` or
 * set `WANIWANI_TEMPLATE` to a branch ref or a local checkout.
