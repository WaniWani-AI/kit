/**
 * The framework boundary.
 *
 * The generated project is built on a third-party MCP framework, and that
 * framework's CLI narrates itself: a branded banner on `dev`, `build` and
 * `start`, pointers at its own hosted tunnel and playground, a support link, and
 * an analytics event per command. An app author is using `waniwani`, so none of
 * that is output to hand them. Every place the framework speaks is intercepted
 * here rather than scattered across the commands.
 *
 * Three seams do the work:
 *
 *   dev     `--plain` drops the interactive UI and writes each diagnostic to
 *           stderr as one plain line, which makes the stream rewritable.
 *   build   the step list behind the interactive UI is plain data, so this CLI
 *           loads it, drives the steps, and prints the progress itself.
 *   start   the banner is ordinary `console.log`, so stdout is rewritten the
 *           same way as dev's stderr.
 *
 * What no amount of output rewriting reaches: the devtools page served at the
 * dev server's root is the framework's own UI, and the generated project names
 * the framework in its `tsconfig`, its dependencies, and its type-output
 * directory. Nothing here is concealment — the dependency is declared in
 * `package.json` like any other. It is a house style: one CLI does the talking.
 *
 * Module specifiers, the dependency name, the telemetry variable and the
 * patterns that have to match the framework's own strings are load-bearing and
 * stay as they are. Prose does not.
